### Installation

Follow these steps to install the neccesary dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

This must be done inside the folder of the cloned repo.

That should be it!

## Usage

I have included a couple commands to run the project:

- This will launch the application (without hot reload)

```sh
npm run start
```

- This will launch the application (with hot reload)

```sh
npm run dev
```

- This will launch the React part of the application (with hot reload)

```sh
npm run react:dev
```

- This will launch the Electron part of the application (with hot reload)

```sh
npm run electron:dev
```

- This will make a Windows installer for the application to distribute

```sh
npm run production
```

- If you want to change the icon of the application this can be done in package.json (icon). Make sure the icon is in the build directory!
