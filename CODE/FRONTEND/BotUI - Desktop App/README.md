## Instalation

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

I have included a couple commands to run the project:

- This will launch the application (without hot reload)

```sh
npm run start
```

- This will launch the application (with hot reload)

```sh
npm run dev
```

- This will launch the React part of the application (with hot reload)

```sh
npm run react:dev
```

- This will launch the Electron part of the application (with hot reload)

```sh
npm run electron:dev
```

- This will make a Windows installer for the application to distribute

```sh

```
